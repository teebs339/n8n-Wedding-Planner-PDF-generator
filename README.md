# n8n Wedding Planner PDF Automation 
Webhook ‚Üí Google Sheets ‚Üí n8n ‚Üí Google Slides/PDF ‚Üí Google Drive/Gmail

## Overview
This project automates the generation of a personalized **wedding planner PDF** based on form submissions collected through a **webhook payload**. Only the submission ID is taken from the webhook which is then mapped on the Google Sheet to get all the details from the particular row **see example links and images below**

When a user fills out the form, their responses are processed end-to-end through **Google Sheets** and **n8n**, resulting in a beautifully formatted **PDF planner** (template preview provided)

## üß© Workflow Summary

### 1. Wix Form Submission (can use any form, just the 'Submission ID' in the webhook is required)
A custom Wix form collects detailed information from users regarding their wedding day including **timeline**, **vendors**, **locations**, **notes**, and **special requests**.  
The form is clean, well-structured, and designed for an elegant user experience.

### 2. Wix Automation ‚Üí Google Sheets + Webhook
Once the user submits the form:
- The form data is **automatically sent to a linked Google Sheet** via Wix‚Äôs native automation.
- In the same automation, a **Webhook** is triggered.  
  This webhook carries the entire **payload** (every question and answer) to **n8n** for further processing.

### 3. n8n Workflow (Automation Engine)
The `n8n` workflow takes over from here.  
It listens for the incoming webhook and performs the following steps:

1. **Webhook Trigger** ‚Äî Receives the submission data from Wix.
2. **Google Sheets Integration** ‚Äî Fetches or verifies the form entry for consistency.
3. **AI Data Processor (ChatGPT Model)** ‚Äî Parses all the user answers, cleans the data, and converts them into structured JSON sections:
   - **Timeline**
   - **Vendors**
   - **Notes/Details**
   - **Locations**
   - **Wedding Name & Time**
4. **Data Formatting Scripts (Custom JavaScript Nodes)** ‚Äî Splits, formats, and aligns text into **columns (left, middle, right)** depending on content type (e.g., vendors vs. timeline).
5. **Google Slides API** ‚Äî Inserts the processed data into a wedding planner **Google Slides template**.  
   Each category (timeline, vendors, notes, etc.) is styled and placed in its respective text boxes.
6. **Final Export (PDF)** ‚Äî The Google Slides file is used to export a finished **Wedding Planner PDF** for the client.

## üß† AI-Powered Data Processing
The n8n workflow uses an **AI Agent (GPT-5)** node to intelligently transform raw form responses into a structured JSON that defines all event details neatly and consistently.

Example output (simplified):
```json
{
  "timeline": [
    { "time": "09:00 AM", "data": ["Bride gets ready"] },
    { "time": "10:30 AM", "data": ["First look with groom"] }
  ],
  "vendors": [
    { "header": "DJ or Band", "name": "DJ Megladon", "phone": "+1234567890", "email": "djmegladon@gmail.com" }
  ],
  "notes_details": [
    "Outdoor setup with floral arch",
    "Private dining for couple before reception"
  ],
  "locations": [
    { "header": "Ceremony Location", "address": "Al Qasr Ballroom, Dubai" }
  ],
  "wedding_name_time": {
    "names": "John & Doe",
    "date": "12/13/2025",
    "time": "09:00 PM"
  }
}
```
